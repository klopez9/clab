"C-Lab" assignment in computer science class

This lab assignment was designed to get us (the students) better acquainted with the C programming language. This program:

----takes a specified .txt file of random words as input and creates a sorted array

----allows the user to perform multiple dictionary functions after the array is loaded, such as

--------search()

--------insertWord()

--------removeWord()

--------printArray()

----outputs the array in its current state into the specified .txt file when the program exits

We were allowed to use any sorting algorithm we wished. I used a form of insertion sort. I didn't have the time to implement a better algorithm--at some point I might implement quicksort or Timsort if I feel so inclined.
